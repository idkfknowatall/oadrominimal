# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an elegant voting system that allows only Discord-authenticated users to vote on songs with like/dislike functionality. The system integrates with AzuraCast API to fetch current song information, uses Firebase for data persistence, and Discord OAuth for authentication. The system will be secure, error-free, and provide real-time voting on currently playing songs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the existing Discord authentication to access voting functionality, so that I can participate in the voting system securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL display "Login to vote" message
2. WHEN a user is authenticated via existing Discord OAuth THEN the system SHALL enable voting functionality
3. WHEN displaying voting interface THEN the system SHALL show the user's authentication status
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL associate votes with their Discord user ID
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL disable voting buttons and show login prompt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to vote on the currently playing song with like/dislike options, so that I can express my opinion about the music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user views the current song THEN the system SHALL display like and dislike buttons
2. WHEN a user clicks the like button THEN the system SHALL record their positive vote for the current song in Firebase
3. WHEN a user clicks the dislike button THEN the system SHALL record their negative vote for the current song in Firebase
4. WHEN a user has already voted on the current song THEN the system SHALL highlight their current vote selection
5. WHEN a user changes their vote on the current song THEN the system SHALL update their previous vote in Firebase
6. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL disable voting buttons and show login prompt

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see current song information and real-time vote counts, so that I can understand what's playing and the community sentiment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch current song information from AzuraCast API
2. WHEN displaying song information THEN the system SHALL show song title, artist, and album artwork
3. WHEN votes are cast THEN the system SHALL update vote counts in real-time
4. WHEN displaying vote counts THEN the system SHALL show separate counts for likes and dislikes for the current song
5. WHEN vote counts change THEN the system SHALL animate the count updates smoothly
6. WHEN multiple users vote simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates correctly
7. WHEN the song changes THEN the system SHALL update to show the new song and reset voting interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically update when songs change, so that I can vote on the current playing song.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new song starts playing THEN the system SHALL fetch updated song information from AzuraCast API
2. WHEN song information updates THEN the system SHALL display the new song details
3. WHEN a song changes THEN the system SHALL clear previous voting state and show fresh voting options
4. WHEN AzuraCast API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and retry
5. WHEN song updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain user authentication state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the voting system to be secure and prevent manipulation, so that vote integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing votes THEN the system SHALL ensure one vote per Discord user per song
2. WHEN processing votes THEN the system SHALL validate user authentication on every request
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling and user feedback
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use Firebase security rules to prevent unauthorized access
5. IF vote manipulation is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the request and log the attempt

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want an elegant and responsive interface, so that voting is intuitive and works on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the voting interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth hover and click animations
2. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout
3. WHEN buttons are interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
