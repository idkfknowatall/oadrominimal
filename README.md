## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application is built with a simplified, modern architecture focused on performance and maintainability.

- **Frontend**: The user interface is a **Next.js 14** application using the **App Router**. It leverages **React Server Components** for performance and **Client Components** for interactivity. State is managed with React Context.
- **Backend API**: The backend is composed of **Next.js Route Handlers**, which provide API endpoints for streaming metadata and system status.
- **Audio Streaming**: Direct HLS audio stream integration with real-time metadata updates via Server-Sent Events.
- **Deployment**: Production deployment using **PM2** process manager for reliability and automatic restarts.
- **Security**: Middleware-based security with rate limiting, CORS protection, and secure headers.

## üéµ Audio Streaming

The application provides a streamlined audio experience without persistent data storage.

- **Live Stream**: Direct HLS audio stream with real-time metadata
- **Song Information**: Dynamic display of currently playing track information
- **Playback Controls**: Standard audio controls with volume and timeline management
- **Background Visualization**: Audio-reactive visual effects synchronized with the stream

## üì° API Endpoints

Simplified API structure focused on streaming functionality:

- **`/api/radio-stream`**: Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time radio metadata
- **`/api/song/[songId]`**: Individual song information (returns unavailable message)
- **`/api/interaction-stream`**: Event stream for system status updates
