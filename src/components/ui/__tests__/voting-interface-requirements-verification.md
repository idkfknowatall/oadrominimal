# VotingInterface Component - Requirements Verification

## Task Requirements Verification

### Task 7: Build VotingInterface main component

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

#### Sub-task Requirements:

1. **✅ Create main VotingInterface component that combines vote buttons**
   - Component created at `src/components/ui/voting-interface.tsx`
   - Combines VoteButton components for like/dislike functionality
   - Proper component structure with TypeScript interfaces

2. **✅ Integrate with useVoting hook for state management**
   - Uses `useVoting` hook for all voting state management
   - Passes correct parameters: songId, userId, songTitle, songArtist
   - Handles all hook return values: userVote, voteCount, isVoting, submitVote, error, clearError

3. **✅ Handle authentication state and show "Login to vote" when needed**
   - Displays "Login with Discord to vote on songs" message when not authenticated
   - Shows Discord login button when `onLoginRequired` callback is provided
   - Disables voting buttons when user is not authenticated
   - Calls `onLoginRequired` callback when unauthenticated user tries to vote

4. **✅ Display current user's vote selection with visual highlighting**
   - Passes `userVote` state to VoteButton components as `isActive` prop
   - VoteButton components handle visual highlighting based on active state
   - Shows "You voted: [like/dislike]" in vote summary when authenticated

5. **✅ Add responsive layout for mobile and desktop views**
   - Uses responsive Tailwind classes: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
   - Vote buttons have responsive width: `w-full sm:w-auto`
   - Minimum width for consistency: `min-w-[120px]`
   - Login message section also responsive: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
