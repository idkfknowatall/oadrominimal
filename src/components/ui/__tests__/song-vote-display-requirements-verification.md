# SongVoteDisplay Component - Requirements Verification

## Task Requirements Verification

### ✅ Task 8: Create SongVoteDisplay component

**Status:** COMPLETED

#### Sub-task Requirements:

1. **✅ Build component that displays current song info with voting interface**
   - Component created at `src/components/ui/song-vote-display.tsx`
   - Displays song title, artist, genre, and album artwork
   - Integrates VotingInterface component for voting functionality
   - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

2. **✅ Integrate with existing AzuraCast song data from useNowPlaying hook**
   - Uses `useNowPlaying()` hook from `@/lib/api-cache`
   - Extracts `liveSong` data from the hook's response
   - Handles real-time updates when song data changes
   - Properly transforms AzuraCast API data structure

3. **✅ Show song title, artist, and album artwork alongside voting buttons**
   - Displays song title as main heading
   - Shows artist with "by [Artist]" format
   - Renders album artwork with proper fallback to music icon
   - Positions voting interface below song information
   - Uses responsive flexbox layout

4. **✅ Handle cases when no song is currently playing**
   - Shows "No song currently playing" message when `liveSong` is null
   - Displays helpful message about stream being offline or between songs
   - Provides "Check again" button to refresh data
   - Maintains consistent UI structure even without song data

5. **✅ Add proper loading states while song data is being fetched**
   - Shows loading spinner and "Loading current song..." message
   - Uses proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - Maintains consistent component dimensions during loading
   - Handles loading state from `useNowPlaying` hook

## Specification Requirements Verification

### ✅ Requirement 3.2: Song Information Display
- **WHEN displaying song information THEN the system SHALL show song title, artist, and album artwork**
  - ✅ Song title displayed as prominent heading
  - ✅ Artist shown with clear "by [Artist]" format
  - ✅ Album artwork rendered with proper alt text and fallback
  - ✅ Genre information displayed when available

### ✅ Requirement 3.7: Song Change Handling
- **WHEN the song changes THEN the system SHALL update to show the new song and reset voting interface**
  - ✅ Component re-renders when `useNowPlaying` data changes
  - ✅ VotingInterface receives updated song data
  - ✅ Song information updates automatically via hook
  - ✅ Voting state managed by VotingInterface component

### ✅ Requirement 6.6: Album Artwork Display
- **WHEN displaying song information THEN the system SHALL show album artwork elegantly with proper fallbacks**
  - ✅ Uses Next.js Image component for optimized loading
  - ✅ Proper alt text for accessibility
  - ✅ Fallback music icon when artwork unavailable
  - ✅ Responsive sizing (64px mobile, 80px desktop)
  - ✅ Rounded corners and proper aspect ratio
  - ✅ Error handling for broken image URLs

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
- **Props Interface:** Well-defined TypeScript interface with proper documentation
- **State Management:** Uses `useNowPlaying` hook for data fetching and state
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
- **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels, roles, and semantic HTML
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints

### Integration Points
- **useNowPlaying Hook:** Seamless integration with existing API cache layer
- **VotingInterface:** Proper prop passing and state management
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Styling:** Consistent with existing design system using Tailwind CSS

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors:** Displays error message with retry functionality
- **No Data:** Graceful handling of null/undefined song data
- **Image Errors:** Fallback icon when album artwork fails to load
- **Loading States:** Proper loading indicators with accessibility

### Performance Considerations
- **Image Optimization:** Uses Next.js Image component with proper sizing
- **Memoization:** Component uses React.forwardRef for ref forwarding
- **Efficient Re-renders:** Minimal re-renders through proper dependency management
- **Cache Integration:** Leverages existing SWR cache from useNowPlaying

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (`song-vote-display.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Loading state rendering and accessibility
- ✅ Error state handling and retry functionality
- ✅ No song playing state and user feedback
- ✅ Song information display and formatting
- ✅ Album artwork rendering and fallbacks
- ✅ VotingInterface integration and prop passing
- ✅ Refresh functionality and user interactions
- ✅ Accessibility attributes and ARIA labels
- ✅ Custom props and className handling

### Demo Component (`song-vote-display-demo.tsx`)
- ✅ Interactive demonstration of all states
- ✅ Authentication toggle functionality
- ✅ State switching for testing different scenarios
- ✅ Visual verification of requirements compliance

## Code Quality
