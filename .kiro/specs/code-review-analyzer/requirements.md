# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a simple code review script specifically for the radio station project to identify duplicate code patterns and unused imports/components. The tool will help maintain the codebase by finding redundant React components, duplicate utility functions, and unused imports that can be cleaned up.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a radio station developer, I want to find duplicate React components and utility functions, so that I can consolidate similar functionality and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script analyzes React components THEN it SHALL identify components with similar JSX structure and props
2. WHEN duplicate utility functions are found THEN the script SHALL report their locations and suggest consolidation
3. WHEN analyzing the src/ directory THEN the script SHALL focus on TypeScript and TSX files only
4. WHEN duplicate code is found THEN the script SHALL show the file paths and line numbers
5. IF components have similar names or functionality THEN the script SHALL group them for review

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a radio station developer, I want to identify unused imports and components, so that I can clean up the codebase and reduce bundle size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script scans source files THEN it SHALL identify unused import statements
2. WHEN unused components are detected THEN the script SHALL list them with their file locations
3. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the script SHALL check if imported items are actually used in the file
4. IF an import is only used in comments or strings THEN the script SHALL mark it as potentially unused
5. WHEN checking component usage THEN the script SHALL scan for component references across all files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a radio station developer, I want a simple command to run the code review, so that I can quickly check for issues without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the code review THEN the script SHALL use a simple npm script command
2. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the script SHALL use sensible defaults for the radio station project
3. IF the script runs successfully THEN it SHALL output results to the console in a readable format
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the script SHALL show a summary of findings
5. WHEN no issues are found THEN the script SHALL display a success message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a radio station developer, I want to see clear output about code issues, so that I can prioritize what to fix first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate code is found THEN the script SHALL show file paths and brief code snippets
2. WHEN unused imports are detected THEN the script SHALL list them by file with line numbers
3. IF multiple issues exist THEN the script SHALL categorize them by type (duplicates, unused imports, unused components)
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the script SHALL use colors or formatting to highlight important information
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the script SHALL show total counts for each issue type
