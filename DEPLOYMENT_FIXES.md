# OADRO Radio - Production Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Policy Errors
**Problem**: App hosted on `https://oadro.com` was being blocked when trying to access API endpoints due to CORS policy.

**Solution**: 
- Added `https://oadro.com` to allowed origins in `src/middleware-enhanced.ts`
- Updated CORS configuration to allow both `radio.oadro.com` and `oadro.com`

### 2. Direct API Calls Causing CORS Issues
**Problem**: `src/lib/api-cache.ts` was making direct requests to AzuraCast API from client-side, causing CORS errors.

**Solution**:
- Modified `api-cache.ts` to use Next.js API routes instead of direct AzuraCast calls
- Changed endpoints from `https://radio.oadro.com/api/station/oadro` to `/api/radio-meta` and `/api/health`
- All external API calls now properly route through Next.js middleware

### 3. Rate Limiting Issues (429 Errors)
**Problem**: App was hitting rate limits during initialization, causing 429 errors.

**Solution**:
- Increased rate limits in `src/middleware-enhanced.ts`:
  - `/api/radio-meta`: 60 → 120 requests/minute
  - `/api/health`: 120 → 200 requests/minute
  - Default: 100 → 150 requests/minute
  - Other endpoints also increased proportionally

### 4. Production Environment Configuration
**Problem**: Production environment variables were not properly configured for the actual domain.

**Solution**:
- Updated `.env.production` with correct domain configuration:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://oadro.com`
  - `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=https://oadro.com/api/auth/callback`
  - Added proper AzuraCast configuration variables

## Files Modified

1. `src/middleware-enhanced.ts` - CORS and rate limiting fixes
2. `src/lib/api-cache.ts` - API routing fixes
3. `.env.production` - Production environment configuration
4. `error.txt` - Removed (analysis completed)

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure `.env.production` is used in production environment
- All API calls now go through Next.js middleware for proper CORS handling
- Rate limits are more generous to prevent 429 errors during normal usage
- Discord OAuth should now work correctly with the production domain

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test API endpoints: `/api/radio-meta`, `/api/health`, `/api/requests`
2. Verify CORS headers are present in responses
3. Check that rate limiting allows normal usage patterns
4. Test Discord OAuth flow with production domain
5. Monitor for any remaining CORS or 429 errors in browser console
